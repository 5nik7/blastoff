# Everyday Termux quickstart

Termux has prior native validation; current installer results belong in STATUS.md.
Native Windows remains deferred. The user reported a working installation and
37 migrated themes; the agent has not updated that live installation. Review
[the update plan](TERMUX-INSTALL-PLAN.md) for 0.1.6: `bash install.sh --dry-run`,
then `bash install.sh` when wanted. Native Termux defaults to `$PREFIX` and public
install migrates verified legacy `~/.local` ownership. Native discovery is preferred;
custom prefixes may need owned profile hooks. Linked profiles are never rewritten.
Python 3.11+ and Bash are required; Starship is needed only for presets. fzf/gum
are optional.

## Linked dotfiles storage

Starting with 0.1.6, an existing link such as
`~/.config/blastoff -> ~/dots/config/blastoff` works without an override.
The target must already be a directory. Blastoff leaves the link intact and
stores themes, modules, backups and its operation lock in that target.
`blastoff doctor --json` reports the real storage path.

Only the storage-root path and its ancestors may redirect writes. Do not link
`themes`, `modules`, `backups` or individual stored files separately. Broken
root links fail without creating their targets. Active config protections are
unchanged: if `.config` itself is linked, use a real-path `STARSHIP_CONFIG`;
`--replace-link` applies only to the active config file, not storage.

For an older installed build, this temporary override avoids the root link:

```sh
BLASTOFF_HOME="$HOME/dots/config/blastoff" blastoff doctor --json
```

Use the same prefix with your intended command until you explicitly upgrade.
This does not move storage or edit shell profiles. Source changes alone do not
update an installed command; review `bash install.sh --dry-run` before installing.

## Try the commands without touching your prompt

Run this in Bash or Zsh **after an approved installation**. The parentheses
isolate environment changes; the directory is retained for inspection. Before
installation, replace the `bo` function with `bo() { bash bin/blastoff "$@"; }`
from the repository root.

```sh
(
  sandbox=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp}/blastoff-demo.XXXXXXXX") || exit
  export STARSHIP_CONFIG="$sandbox/config space/starship.toml"
  export BLASTOFF_HOME="$sandbox/storage space"
  export STARSHIP_CACHE="$sandbox/starship-cache"
  bo() { "$PREFIX/bin/blastoff" "$@"; }
  mkdir -p "$sandbox/config space"
  printf '[directory]\nstyle = "purple"\n' > "$STARSHIP_CONFIG"

  bo                                   # branded welcome, no discovery
  bo --version                         # blastoff 0.1.6
  bo doctor --json                     # config/storage point inside sandbox
  bo list                              # local themes + available Starship presets
  bo theme save daily                  # snapshot current config as daily
  bo theme copy local:daily spare       # copy stored theme without applying
  bo theme list                        # daily and spare among local themes
  bo theme apply local:spare            # identical bytes retained; no backup needed
  bo current                           # matching local names/config information

  bo module save directory dir-style    # store explicit [directory] table
  bo module list                       # dir-style
  bo module load dir-style              # merge table, preserve unrelated settings

  bo backup create                     # prints a backup ID
  bo backup list                       # inspect IDs; choose the config backup above
  # Replace ID with that actual ID (not the literal word ID):
  # bo backup restore ID                # restores backed-up config, backs up replaced config

  # Optional preset: exact name comes from `bo preset list`:
  # bo preset list
  # bo preset save plain-text-symbols plain  # stores a preset without applying it
  # bo theme apply local:plain          # replaces only sandbox config, with backup

  # Optional interactive picker, from a terminal (not a pipe):
  # bo pick
  printf 'Inspect retained sandbox: %s\n' "$sandbox"
)
```

Expected: mutations stay inside the printed sandbox, and your actual prompt
configuration remains unchanged. Backup IDs are generated, so copy the actual ID
from the output. The `plain-text-symbols` example matches Starship 1.26.0;
check your installed preset list rather than assume all versions have it.

For everyday use after default installation, invoke `"$PREFIX/bin/blastoff"`
(or your actual custom-prefix command) with the same arguments, **without** sandbox
overrides. Until migration, a legacy installation may still be under `~/.local`. On this machine
`STARSHIP_CONFIG` currently selects `~/dots/config/starship/starship.toml`;
applying/loading/restoring would then change that real file. First run `doctor
--json`, save a named theme and create a backup. Do not infer the destination
from the storage directory: `BLASTOFF_HOME` controls storage only.

Existing destination names refuse overwrite unless `--force` is supplied;
forced replacements are backed up. Use `local:NAME` to avoid preset ambiguity.
`theme import /absolute/path/to/file.toml NAME` imports without applying it.
Missing/failing Starship does not hide local themes: combined listing and pick
warn on stderr and continue with locals (a timeout can take ten seconds).
`list --json` instead includes `preset_discovery.status` (`ok` or `unavailable`)
and `preset_discovery.error` in its single stdout object, with no warning on
stderr. Combined listing exits 0 even when empty; pick exits 1 without opening a
picker if no choices remain. Explicit preset requests still fail with status 3
when discovery fails. A successful empty preset list is not a failure.
Quote paths with spaces. Names are portable ASCII letters/digits, `_` and `-`,
up to 96 characters; names start with a letter/digit and Windows device names
are excluded. No custom Starship commands are run by validation.

Fzf now shows a purple/pink selector with local:/preset: labels. Its pane is a
**configuration preview**, not a rendered Starship prompt: no theme-defined
commands are run. Alt-P toggles the preview, which moves below the list on narrow
screens and starts hidden in short terminals. Gum/numbered fallbacks have clear
labels/instructions but no preview pane. `NO_COLOR` or `--color never` removes
color; no Nerd Font is needed.

Picker selection applies a theme. Cancellation exits 130 without changing
config/storage: Escape/Ctrl-C in fzf/gum; blank Enter, Escape then Enter, Ctrl-D
or Ctrl-C in the numbered fallback. Missing fzf/gum automatically falls back.
Use `--help` after any subcommand; use `--json` for machine output, not with pick.
Completion activation and manual commands are in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

## Smallest remaining human check

Automated native PTYs have passed; screen appearance and your Android keyboard
still need human confirmation. From the repository in your ordinary terminal:

```sh
python3 scripts/interactive_check.py --backend fzf --expect select
python3 scripts/interactive_check.py --backend fzf --expect cancel
```

Choose alpha/beta in the first; press Ctrl-C in the second. Expect `PASS`, exit
0/130 respectively, and `config/storage unchanged=True` for cancellation.
Report terminal app, width, clipping, and whether cursor/echo return normally.
Use `--backend numbered` instead if that is your intended everyday backend
(blank Enter cancels). The complete optional gum/Escape/narrow-width and
shell-plugin checklist remains in [INTERACTIVE-CHECKS.md](INTERACTIVE-CHECKS.md);
this small check does not claim those remaining human checks passed.
